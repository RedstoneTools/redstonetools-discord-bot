# Redstone tools discord bot

A discord bot for the rst [discord server](https://discord.gg/nXWmrAsJQ8)

## Auto github link
When sending a message with a "#" and a number (exampel #123) the bot will try to find an issue or pull request with the same number and link it in the channel


## Faq System
Faqs can be made with `/faq-create`, this opens a modal on the discord client
Faqs can then be referenced with the `/faq <faq>` command

## Feature Request Helpers
`/feature accept` will add the Accepted tag to the request and will open a github issue with the same name
`/feature deny <Duplicate | Other>` will lock the post and add the specified tag
